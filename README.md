Random Forest and Regularization Models for Income Classification
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset to predict whether individuals earn more than $50K annually using advanced machine learning techniques. The following models are estimated:

Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
Random Forest

The project includes:

Preprocess and data cleaning
Data Analysis
Create training and testing sets
Estimate Lasso and Ridge regressions
Estimate Random Forest models
Compare the models based on classification accuracy.
Interpret results and evaluate model performance using confusion matrices.
